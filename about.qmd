## The Team

**Gilmer Valdes**:
With a background in medical physics, fellowship, and residency in
Therapeutic Medical Physics, I specialize in machine learning for
personalized treatment predictions, focusing on prostate and thoracic
cancers. My recent work emphasizes enhancing model interpretability
through methods like MediBoost, Additive Tree, and Representational
Gradient Boosting. As Vice Chair of Machine Learning and Director of
Clinical AI at Moffitt Cancer Center, I lead clinical AI adoption and
collaborative ICTML projects. I also develop R and Python packages for
cancer analysis (EAML, LINAD, Lockout) and previously directed UCSF's
“Advanced Machine Learning” course. Awarded an NIH BIBK08, my
experience in algorithm development, education, and clinical AI
application equips me to advance ICTML's tools for cancer research.
