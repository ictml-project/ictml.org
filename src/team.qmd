My research explores how advances in causal inference, statistical machine learning, and computational statistics can empower discovery in the biomedical and health sciences. I focus primarily on the development of model-agnostic, assumption-lean statistical inference procedures, doing so while emphasizing a science-first, translational philosophy that stresses the rich interplay between the applied sciences and statistical methodology: how emerging questions in the former spur advances in the latter, which, in turn, help to refine scientific discoveries. To accomplish this, my work leverages causal inference as a framework to translate scientific questions into precise, causally interpretable statistical estimands, and then aims to obtain inference about these from data by formulating analytic methods that incorporate flexible, adaptive modeling strategies (i.e., machine learning), to avoid imposing restrictions that may not be justified by domain knowledge, and semi-parametric efficiency theory for best-in-class uncertainty quantification. I am also interested in statistical instrumentation---that is, high-performance computing and open-source software and programming---to push the boundaries of statistical methodology and to promote transparency and reproducibility in the practice of applied statistics and data science.

![](assets/Phillips_Rachael.webp){.left-aligned-img}

Rachael V. Phillips, PhD is a Biostatistician at the UC Berkeley Research Center for Targeted Machine Learning and Causal Inference (CTML). At CTML, Rachael collaborates with pharmaceutical, regulatory, clinical, and academic researchers. She is also on the core development team of the [TLverse](https://tlverse.org/) open-source software project and corresponding software handbook. Broadly, Rachael’s research integrates targeted machine learning and causal inference to realistically approximate answers to causal questions with statistical confidence. Some highlighted recent work includes the development of frameworks and guidelines for clinical AI-QI, personalized online learning from ICU streaming data, and statistical methodology for complex real-world evidence (RWE) studies including RWE studies in oncology.

With a background in medical physics, fellowship, and residency in
Therapeutic Medical Physics, I specialize in machine learning for
personalized treatment predictions, focusing on prostate and thoracic
cancers. My recent work emphasizes enhancing model interpretability
through methods like MediBoost, Additive Tree, and Representational
Gradient Boosting. As Vice Chair of Machine Learning and Director of
Clinical AI at Moffitt Cancer Center, I lead clinical AI adoption and
collaborative ICTML projects. I also develop R and Python packages for
cancer analysis (EAML, LINAD, Lockout) and previously directed UCSF's
“Advanced Machine Learning” course. Awarded an NIH BIBK08, my
experience in algorithm development, education, and clinical AI
application equips me to advance ICTML's tools for cancer research.

Mark van der Laan is the Jiann-Ping Hsu/Karl E. Peace Professor of Biostatistics and Statistics at the University of California, Berkeley. He graduated in 1993 under supervision of Richard Gill at the Utrecht University in the Netherlands. He started a position in Biostatistics in 1994 and has been at UC Berkeley since. He has made contributions to survival analysis, semiparametric statistics, multiple testing, censored data and causal inference. He also developed the targeted maximum likelihood methodology and general theory for super-learning. He is a founding editor of the Journal of Causal Inference and International Journal of Biostatistics. He has authored 4 books on targeted learning, censored data and multiple testing, authored over 300 publications, and graduated 55 Ph.D students. He received the COPSS Presidents' Award in 2005, the Mortimer Spiegelman Award in 2004, and the van Dantzig Award in 2005, among various others.
