My recent work emphasizes enhancing model interpretability through methods like MediBoost, Additive Tree, and Representational Gradient Boosting. As Vice Chair of Machine Learning and Director of Clinical AI at Moffitt Cancer Center, I lead clinical AI adoption and collaborative ICTML projects. I also develop R and Python packages for cancer analysis (EAML, LINAD, Lockout) and previously directed UCSF’s “Advanced Machine Learning” course. Awarded an NIH BIBK08, my experience in algorithm development, education, and clinical AI application equips me to advance ICTML’s tools for cancer research."
